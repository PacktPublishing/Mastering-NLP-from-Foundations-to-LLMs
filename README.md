### Book Description
Do you want to master Natural Language Processing (NLP) but don’t know where to begin? This book will give you the right head start. Written by leaders in machine learning and NLP, Mastering NLP from Foundations to LLMs provides an in-depth introduction to techniques. Starting with the mathematical foundations of machine learning (ML), you’ll gradually progress to advanced NLP applications such as large language models (LLMs) and AI applications. You’ll get to grips with linear algebra, optimization, probability, and statistics, which are essential for understanding and implementing machine learning and NLP algorithms. You’ll also explore general machine learning techniques and find out how they relate to NLP. Next, you’ll learn how to preprocess text data, explore methods for cleaning and preparing text for analysis, and understand how to do text classification. You’ll get all of this and more along with complete Python code samples.

By the end of the book, the advanced topics of LLMs’ theory, design, and applications will be discussed along with the future trends in NLP, which will feature expert opinions. You’ll also get to strengthen your practical skills by working on sample real-world NLP business problems and solutions.

### What you will learn
* Master the mathematical foundations of machine learning and NLP Implement advanced techniques for preprocessing text data and analysis Design ML-NLP systems in Python
* Model and classify text using traditional machine learning and deep learning methods
* Understand the theory and design of LLMs and their implementation for various applications in AI
* Explore NLP insights, trends, and expert opinions on its future direction and potential

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Load the record dict from URL
import requests
import pickle
```

### Who this book is for
This book is for deep learning and machine learning researchers, NLP practitioners, ML/NLP educators, and STEM students.
